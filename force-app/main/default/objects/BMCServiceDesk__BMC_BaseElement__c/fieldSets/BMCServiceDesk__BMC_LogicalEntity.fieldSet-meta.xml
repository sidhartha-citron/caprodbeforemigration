    <description>LogicalEntity: CMDB Class used to store all of the components in a system that represent abstract system components. Examples of logical enitities might be Payroll Processes or North American Sales.  You use these CI types to define accounts, business processes, databases, and so on.  Abstract classes cannot hold any instances. Instead, use subclasses such as BMC_Activity and BMC_BusinessService to represent particular types of logical entities in your IT environment, such as Service Model components.  This class corresponds to the DMTF CIM_LogicalElement class.</description>
