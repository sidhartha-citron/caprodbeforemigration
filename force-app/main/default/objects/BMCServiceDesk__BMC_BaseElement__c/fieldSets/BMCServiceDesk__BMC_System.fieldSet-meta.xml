    <description>System: CMDB Abstract class that defines the systems in your organization. By definition, abstract classes cannot hold any instances. You use them only in special cases to organize subclasses so that you have the flexibility to add a layer of organization without a database join. Instead, use subclasses such as BMC_ApplicationSystem, BMC_Cluster, and BMC_ComputerSystem to represent particular types of systems.  A system is a logical element that groups base elements; the group operates as a functional whole, providing the scope for numerous components. Although a system may be viewed as a collection, a collection is simply a container for its members, while a system is a higher-level abstraction built out of its individual components. It is more than the sum of its parts.  For example, systems can serve as anchors that hold multiple items together, (such as computer systems, clusters, application systems, and domains).</description>
