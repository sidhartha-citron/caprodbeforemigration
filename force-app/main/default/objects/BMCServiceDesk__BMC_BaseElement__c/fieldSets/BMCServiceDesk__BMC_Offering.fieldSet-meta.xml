    <description>Offering: CMDB Class that stores information about service offerings that are part of a high-level service. Service offerings are container objects that combine the utility (business or technical service), and the warranty (defined by Service Level Targets) to bring value to customers. For example, a business service offering may have an SLT that requires that IT Support can deliver the service to customers in no more than two hours. This service offering might be named ERP Gold, based on a service called ERP defined in the service catalog. Business customers do not subscribe to services, they subscribe to service offerings.</description>
