    <description>LocalFileSystem: CMDB Class that stores information about the organization of files residing on a computer system (BMC_ComputerSystem instance). Such files are directly managed by the computer system without the need for another computer to act as a file server. In a clustered file system, each file system is an instance of BMC_LocalFileSystem, weak to the cluster. To represent the cluster, use the BMC_Cluster class. To relate instances of BMC_LocalFileSystem to the cluster, you can use the BMC_HostedSystemComponents class. This class corresponds to the DMTF CIM_LocalFileSystem class.</description>
