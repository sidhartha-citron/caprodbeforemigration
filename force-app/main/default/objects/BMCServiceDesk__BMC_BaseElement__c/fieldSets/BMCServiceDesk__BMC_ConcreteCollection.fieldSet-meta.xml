    <description>ConcreteCollection: CMDB Class used to store a generic and instantiable collection, such as a pool of hosts available for running jobs. This class is defined as a concrete subclass of BMC_Collection and was added rather than changing BMC_Collection from an abstract class to a concrete class. BMC_ConcreteCollection must not be subclassed When extending the common data model. Instead, you should define new functionality in the existing BMC_Collection subclasses or create new subclasses.  This class corresponds to the CIM_ConcreteCollection DMTF CIM class.</description>
