    <description>SystemSoftware: CMDB Class that stores information about operating systems and all utility programs that manage computer resources at a low level. Use subclasses of this class to represent specific operating system and BIOS (basic input/output system) software elements in your IT environment. For example, IT administrators can use the BMC_VirtualSystemEnabler subclass (and its BMC_VMWare subclass) to configure virtualization software and hardware in their data center.
