    <description>HardwarePackage: CMDB Class that stores information about hardware components that are made up of other hardware components. Use this class to represent hardware components that are not represented by other CDM classes. For example, chassis and monitors are represented by the CDM classes BMC_Chassis and BMC_Monitor, but no BMC class represents RAID disk arrays. To relate instances of the BMC_HardwareSystemComponent class to an instance of this class, you can use the BMC_HostedSystemComponents class. This class has no corresponding DMTF CIM class.</description>
