    <description>AccessPoint: CMDB Abstract class that defines communication endpoints in your IT environment. The BMC_AccessPoint class groups together access-point related classes. An access point represents the ability to use or invoke a service. This characteristic is further defined by BMC_ProtocolEndpoint, the only direct subclass of BMC_AccessPoint.  By definition, abstract classes cannot hold any instances. You use them only in special cases to organize subclasses so that you have the flexibility to add a layer of organization without a database join. Therefore, you might use subclasses such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, IPX addresses, and so forth. Instances of the BMC_AccessPoint class are related to a system through a BMC_HostedAccessPoint dependency relationship.  This class corresponds to the DMTF class CIM_ServiceAccessPoint.</description>
