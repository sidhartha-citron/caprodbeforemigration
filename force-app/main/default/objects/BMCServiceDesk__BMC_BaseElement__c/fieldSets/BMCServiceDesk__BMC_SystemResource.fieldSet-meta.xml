    <description>SystemResource: CMDB Class that stores information about an entity managed by a BIOS (basic input/output system), an operating system, or other software that is available for use by application software, logical devices, or both. System resources are individually identified and allocated entities that are assignable, reservable, counted or tracked, releasable, resetable, and so on. Examples of software resources are message queues, shared memory segments (identified by a key value), and named pipes. Examples of hardware resources in an x86 environment are IRQs, DMA channels, and memory-mapped I/O. Another example is J2EE resources used by a J2EE server to provide the J2EE standard services required by the J2EE platform architecture. This class corresponds to the DMTF CIM_SystemResource class.</description>
