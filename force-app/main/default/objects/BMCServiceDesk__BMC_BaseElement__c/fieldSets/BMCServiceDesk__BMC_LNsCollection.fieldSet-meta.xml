    <description>LNsCollection: Class that represents groups of logical networks (LNs) that are, in turn, collections of endpoints. For example, you can use this class to group IPSubnets that are deployed across the same physical LAN or WAN. You can also use this class to model subsets of larger physical networks. For example, if you have ten computers connected to the same networking backbone, you could have five of the computers on the address range 192.168.0.x, and the other five computers on the address range 172.16.10.x. Although they are physically connected to the same backbone, the two groups of five computers are part of two separate logical networks. This class has no corresponding DMTF CIM class.</description>
