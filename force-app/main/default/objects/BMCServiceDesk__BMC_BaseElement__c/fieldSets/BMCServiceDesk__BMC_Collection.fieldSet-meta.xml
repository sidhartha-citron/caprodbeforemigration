    <description>Collection: CMDB Abstract class that stores information about collections of configuration items (CIs) related to the people and organizational characteristics of your IT environment. By definition, abstract classes cannot hold any instances. You use them only in special cases to organize subclasses so that you have the flexibility to add a layer of organization without a database join. Therefore, you should use subclasses of BMC_Collection (for example, BMC_Role and BMC_Organization) to represent particular groups of CIs in your IT environment.  For example, BMC_Role models the roles for granting permissions and representing participants in your business processes and transactions.  This class, formerly named BMC_Group in the BMC Atrium CMDB 1.0, corresponds to the DMTF class CIM_Collection.</description>
