    <description>UserCommunity: CMDB Class that stores information about a collection of users (persons) who consume business services. Typically, the users are external to the organization or they cross organizational boundaries. While BMC_Role and BMC_Organization CIs represent official designations within your business, CIs that you populate within the BMC_UserCommunity class can be more informal. For example, you might group internet users in this class to represent a broad audience.   The BMC_UserCommunity class will be deprecated in a future release. You should instead use BMC_Organization or BMC_ConcreteCollection to model users who consume business services.  The BMC_UserCommunity class has no corresponding DMTF CIM class.</description>
