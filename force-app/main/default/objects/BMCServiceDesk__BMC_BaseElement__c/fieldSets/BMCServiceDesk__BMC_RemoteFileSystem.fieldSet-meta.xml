    <description>RemoteFileSystem: CMDB Class that stores information about file systems that are not directly connected to a computer system. Instead, they are hosted by a computer acting as a file server. Use this class to represent file systems that a computer gains access to through a network-related service. For example, the file store for a network file system is typically NOT on a computer&apos;s locally controlled media, nor is it directly accessed through a device driver. This class corresponds to the DMTF CIM_RemoteFileSystem class.</description>
