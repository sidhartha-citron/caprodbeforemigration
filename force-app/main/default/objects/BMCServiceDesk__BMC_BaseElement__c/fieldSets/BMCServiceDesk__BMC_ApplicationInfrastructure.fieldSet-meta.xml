    <description>ApplicationInfrastructure: CMDB Class that stores information about the framework (such as SAP or J2EE) that supports applications in a distributed or composite system. This class represents the platform to model your applications. For example, you would model SAP as an instance of BMC_ApplicationInfrastructure. Once an application is deployed in that platform, it can run on any application server in the SAP environment. Application infrastructure objects can be discovered and instantiated; however, they do not have any direct relationship to computers. Only applications and software servers have relationships to computers. This class has no corresponding DMTF CIM class.</description>
