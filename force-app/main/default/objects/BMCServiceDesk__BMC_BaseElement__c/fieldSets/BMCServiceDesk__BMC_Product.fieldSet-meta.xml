    <description>Product: Class stores information about commodities,ex. software. Capture the installed, static aspects of a software product (such as Microsoft Word). You can use this class to represent noncommercial products, such as software programs developed for in-house use only. To represent the installed version of an application, create a BMC_Product instance. To capture the deployed, run-time aspects of long-lived applications, use BMC_SoftwareServer, BMC_Application, or BMC_ApplicationInfrastructure, depending on the type. For example, Microsoft Word installed on your computer is a CI of BMC_Product; however, every running version of Microsoft Word is an instance of BMC_SoftwareServer. As example, you would create a BMC_Product instance to represent the installed version of WebServer, and create several BMC_SoftwareServer instances to represent actual instances of WebServer, one listening on port 80, another on port 8000, and a third on port 8080. Corresponds to DMTF class CIM_Product.</description>
