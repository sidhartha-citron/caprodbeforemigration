    <description>Application: CMDB Class that stores information about standalone applications, applications deployed on servers (such as J2EE and SAP), and applications deployed on distributed systems (such as SAP). An application can be hosted by two different types of environments. The application can run on a physical or virtual system, or it can run on an application server or application system. Therefore, when modeling applications, relate an instance of the BMC_Application class to a hosting BMC_ComputerSystem (physical or virtual), BMC_ApplicationServer, or BMC_ApplicationInfrastructure instance.   For example, if an application runs directly on top of an application server or application system such as an SAP environment, the application has only one relationship, a dependency on the application infrastructure hosting the application.</description>
