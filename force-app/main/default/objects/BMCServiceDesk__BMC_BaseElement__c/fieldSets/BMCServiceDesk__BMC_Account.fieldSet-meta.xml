    <description>Account: CMDB Class that stores information about accounts in your IT environment that are used to access specific resources, and also represents the credentials used to log on to a system. An instance of this class is usually related to a BMC_Person instance representing the user who owns the account, and is always connected to a CI in the subclass of BMC_System. For example, the Name attribute inherited from BMC_BaseElement can define the user name for the account. An account should not exist without a relationship to a system, but it can exist without a relationship to a person. Also, an account should not be connected to more than one person or role.   This class has no corresponding DMTF CIM class.</description>
