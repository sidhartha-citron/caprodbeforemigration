    <description>SystemService:Abstract class that contains the information necessary to represent, configure, and manage the functionality provided by a device or software feature. A service is a general-purpose object to configure and manage the implementation of functionality. For example, IT administrators can use both the SystemClassId and SystemName attributes to specifically configure a service to only systems assigned a specific name and identification number. When the attribute is defined, it is automatically propagated to the related configuration item (CI). Note: a system service is different from a business service, which is considered a logical entity. By definition, abstract classes cannot hold any instances. You use them only in special cases to organize subclasses so that you have the flexibility to add a layer of organization without a database join. Therefore, you might use the only subclass, BMC_ApplicationService, to store information about configuring and managing software features</description>
