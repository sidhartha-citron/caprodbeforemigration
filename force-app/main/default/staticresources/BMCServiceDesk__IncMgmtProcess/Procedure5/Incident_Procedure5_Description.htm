    After a support request has been passed to a specific specialist of a group, this specialist
    reviews the support request information and determines how it should be resolved. The specialist
    escalates the support request to the service owner when it concerns an incident that cannot
    be resolved without Change Management because its resolution will cause:</p>

      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">a service to become unavailable or degraded
        during service hours,</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the functionality of a service to become

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Note that a group coordinator is not able to determine whether Change Management is required
    for the resolution of incidents, as this first requires the investigation by a specialist.<br>
    <br>
    If Change Management is not required, but the specialist has determined that the support request
    needs to be resolved by another specialist, he/she notifies the appropriate group coordinator.
    Otherwise, the specialist resolves the support request and updates it.</p></td>
