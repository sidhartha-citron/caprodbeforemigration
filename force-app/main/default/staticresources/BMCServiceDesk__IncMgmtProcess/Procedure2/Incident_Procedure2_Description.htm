    If the support request concerns a request for support improvement 
    (i.e. a complaint), the service desk analyst assigns the support request to the service desk manager.
    All other support request categories are considered by the service desk analyst for resolution. If the
    service desk analyst is not able to resolve the request (in terms of skills, access rights and time
    restrictions), he/she assigns it to the appropriate group.<br>
    <br>
    Support requests that service level managers passed on to the service desk for assignment are dealt with in
    the same fashion.<br>
    <br>
    All support requests that have been assigned to a group by service desk analysts, operators and the
    continuity manager, and after users and customer representatives submit a web request form,
    are reviewed by the coordinator of the group.<br>
    <br>
    If the group coordinator determines that a support request has been assigned to the wrong group,
    or if a support request does not contain all information that should have been provided by the
    service desk analyst, operator or continuity manager in order to be able to complete it, he/she
    rejects it and specifies the reason for rejection.<br>
    <br>
    Rejected support requests are automatically passed to the service desk. There, a service desk
    analyst ensures that the missing information is collected and/or that these rejected support
    requests get reassigned to the appropriate group if they cannot be resolved by the service
    desk.<br>
    <br>
    Support requests that have been assigned to the correct group, and that contain the required
    information, are passed to the change coordinator of the related service if it concerns a request for a change
    which implementation needs to be coordinated by Change Management. All other support requests
    are passed to the most appropriate specialist of the group (in terms of skills, availability
    and access rights).</p></td>
