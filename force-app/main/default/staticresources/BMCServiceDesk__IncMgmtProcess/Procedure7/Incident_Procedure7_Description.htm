    If the service desk analyst is able to resolve the support request he/she is working on
    (in terms of skills, access rights and time restrictions), he/she resolves and completes
    it.<br>
    <br>
    After the completion of a support request, regardless of who completed it, the service
    desk analyst informs the user who submitted the
    support request and asks the user to verify its solution.<br>
    <br>
    If the user informs the service desk
    that the support request has not been solved in an acceptable fashion, a service desk
    analyst will once more attempt to get it resolved.<br>
    <br>
    Otherwise, the service desk analyst continues by checking if the support request concerns
    a service outage that affected
    multiple users. If that is the case, the service desk analyst informs the people concerned
    of the manner in which the incident has
    been resolved.<br>
    <br>
    The people concerned are:</p>
    <table border="0" cellPadding="0" cellSpacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the affected users,</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the owner of the affected service,</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the customer representative(s)
        of the affected service,</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the service level manager(s)
        of the affected customer organization(s), and</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the on-duty manager.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Finally, if the user has confirmed that the support request has been resolved in a
    satisfactory fashion, or if the user does not respond within 28 days, the support request
    is closed.</p></td>
