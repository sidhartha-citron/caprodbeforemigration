    When a user contacts the service desk, the service desk analyst
    links the user's person record to a new support request. Next, the service desk analyst
    determines the nature of the user's request. This is done by asking the user how
    he/she can be helped, if the user contacted the service desk by phone or in person.
    Alternatively, if the user contacted the service desk in writing (e.g. with an email,
    fax, paper form, etc.) the service desk analyst determines the nature of the request by
    reading through its information.<br>
    <br>
    If the user contacted the service desk about a previously registered support request,
    the service desk analyst looks it up. If the support request was already closed, but the
    user is not satisfied with the solution provided, the service desk reopens it. On the
    other hand, if the user simply wants an update on the support request's status, the
    service desk analyst informs the user of the progress that has been made.<br>
    <br>
    If the user contacted the service desk to submit a new request, the service desk
    analyst determines whether or not a support request template is available for the user's
    request.<br>
    <br>
    If a support request template is available, the service desk analyst uses the template
    to fill out the support request. The service desk analyst reads the instructions from
    the template and follows them. The instructions specify which information to obtain from
    the user and how to proceed after the information has been obtained (e.g. how to
    resolve the request, or to which group it is to be assigned).<br>
    <br>
    In case a support request template is not available for the request of the user, the
    service desk analyst registers the necessary information manually. The service desk analyst
    subsequently links the applicable service and configuration item (if known) to the support
    request.<br>
    <br>
    If the user reported an incident, the service desk analyst continues by determining the impact level based on the information
    provided by the user, the information about the configuration of the service infrastructure, and
    the other incidents that are currently open for the impacted service. The impact level
    and the business importance level (BIL) of the service for the user automatically determine the
    priority level that is assigned to requests for incident resolution. If it does not concern an incident, the service management
    application uses the support request category to automatically assign the correct priority
    level.</p></td>
