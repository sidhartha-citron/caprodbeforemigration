    After a request for support improvement 
    (i.e. a complaint) has been registered, the service desk manager reviews its details.<br>
    <br>
    The service desk manager talks to the involved service desk analyst(s), specialist(s),
    service level manager, customer representative and/or
    user as needed to determine the cause
    of the complaint. Having determined the cause, the service desk manager decides on a way
    to restore the user's faith in the support
    provided by the service provider organization.<br>
    <br>
    After the service desk manager has taken the necessary actions to conciliate the user,
    he/she completes the support request.</p></td>
