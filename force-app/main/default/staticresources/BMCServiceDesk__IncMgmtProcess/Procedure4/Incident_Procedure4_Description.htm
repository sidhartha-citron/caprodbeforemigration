    The service desk keeps track of open support
    requests by checking their status from time to time to ensure that they continue to progress
    towards completion. When a support request is no longer progressing, the service desk analyst
    contacts the coordinator of the group to which the support request is assigned and ask him/her
    to make sure that the support request gets dealt with.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, if a support request describes a new service outage that is impacting multiple
    users, the service desk analyst informs all people concerned. The people concerned are:</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the affected users,</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the owner of the affected service,</p></td>

        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the service level manager(s) of the
        affected customer organization(s), and</p></td>

        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the on-duty manager.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>After half of the available resolution time has passed, and if the
    service outage has not been resolved, the service desk analyst provides the people concerned
    with a progress update.<br>
    <br>
    If the incident still has not been resolved when
    the target date and time have been reached, the service desk analyst provides the people concerned
    with another progress update. After this second update the service desk analyst escalates the incident to the service owner.</p></td>
