    The Incident Management process consists of six procedures for handling support
    requests.<br>
    <br>
    The first procedure is called &quot;Support Request Registration&quot;. This procedure is
    used by service desk analysts when they register requests from users.<br>
    <br>
    The second procedure is called &quot;Support Request Assignment&quot;. Service desk analysts
    use this procedure when they assign support requests to Incident queue, and to the service desk
    manager in case of complaints. They also use this procedure when they handle support
    requests that have been rejected by queue coordinators. Queue coordinators use this
    procedure after support requests have been assigned to their respective groups. They use
    it to assign these support requests to a specific change coordinator or specialist for
    resolution.<br>
    <br>
    The third procedure is called &quot;Complaint Handling&quot;. It is used by the service desk
    manager when he/she works to complete support requests of the category
    &quot;Request for Support Improvement&quot;
    to the satisfaction of the users who submitted them.<br>
    <br>
    The fourth procedure is called &quot;Support Request Tracking&quot;. Service desk analysts
    follow it when they track the progress of support requests.<br>
    <br>
    The fifth procedure is called &quot;Support Request Resolution by Specialist&quot;. It is used
    by specialists to complete support requests that have been assigned to them.<br>
    <!--br>
    The sixth procedure is called &quot;Incident Escalation Handling&quot;. After an
    <a href="Glossary.htm#Incident">incident</a> has been
    <a href="Glossary.htm#Escalate">escalated</a>, the service owner of the affected
    <a href="Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> uses this procedure to determine how the
    incident can be resolved in the most efficient manner.<br-->
    <br>
    The sixth and last procedure is called &quot;Support Request Closure&quot;. This procedure
    is used by service desk analysts when they resolve and close out completed support requests.<br>
