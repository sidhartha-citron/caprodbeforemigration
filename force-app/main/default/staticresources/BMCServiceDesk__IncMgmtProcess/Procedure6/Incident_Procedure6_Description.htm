    After a specialist or a service desk analyst has
    escalated an
    incident, the owner of the affected
    service talks to the specialist(s) who have
    been dealing with the incident to get an understanding of the current situation and to
    determine how the incident had best be resolved. If the recovery of the affected service
    at its continuity site is the most
    efficient and reliable way to resolve the incident, the service owner escalates the
    incident to the on-duty manager to get the service recovery started.<br>
    <br>
    In most cases, however, the recovery of a service at its continuity site is either not
    going to fix the incident (e.g. when the incident is caused by a
    bug), or the implementation of a fix within the
    service's current infrastructure is going to be more efficient and reliable. In such cases,
    the service owner continues by determining whether the resolution of the incident needs
    to be coordinated by Change Management. Change Management is required when the resolution
    of the incident will cause:</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">a service to become
        unavailable or degraded during service hours,</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the
        functionality of a service to become
        different, or</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">the
        CMDB to require an update.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If Change Management is not required, the service owner ensures
    that the most appropriate specialist(s) continue to resolve the incident within the Incident
    Management process.<br>
    <br>
    On the other hand, if Change Management is required, the service owner consults with the
    specialist(s) to gain an understanding of the risks that could cause the implementation of
    the change to fail and the impact of the implementation on
    customers. Together, they figure out the best way
    to keep the risk and impact of the change implementation at an acceptable level. After they have
    established how the change should be implemented, the service owner asks the specialist(s) to
    perform the implementation as an emergency change.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the role of service owner is performed by the on-duty manager when the service owner
    of the affected service is not available.</p></td>
