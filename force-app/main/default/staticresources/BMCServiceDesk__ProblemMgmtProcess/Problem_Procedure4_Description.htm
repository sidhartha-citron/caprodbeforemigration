    After a change has been implemented to provide a structural solution for the
    problem, the problem coordinator verifies whether
    or not the change has actually solved the problem.<br>
    <br>
    If the implementation appears to have solved the problem, the problem coordinator closes it. If
    the problem was reactively identified, the service management application subsequently informs
    the service desk via email that it has been
    removed from the service.<br>
    <br>
    On the other hand, if the change was not implemented, or if the implementation did not fix the
    problem, the problem coordinator determines if it might be possible to propose a different
    structural solution for the problem. If this might be possible, the problem coordinator
    reassigns the problem to a specialist within his/her group.<br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, if it is clear that there is currently no practical means available to
    permanently work around or remove the root cause,
    the problem coordinator updates the problem to indicate the impasse. Periodically, the
    problem coordinator will then check for new possibilities and will ask for another
    analysis when it is likely that a
    new or different approach or technology could provide a practical structural solution.</p></td>
