						After a specialist has completed the root cause analysis of a problem, the 
						problem coordinator reviews the results to determine if a structural solution 
						has been proposed or has been implemented already. If the specialist has 
						already solved the problem because Change Management was not required to 
						coordinate the implementation of the structural solution, the problem 
						coordinator goes directly to <A href="Problem_Procedure4_Frames.htm" target="ProblemProcMainFrame">
							Procedure 4, Problem Closure</A> .<br>
						<br>
						The problem coordinator also goes to <a href="Problem_Procedure4_Frames.htm" target="ProblemProcMainFrame">
							Procedure 4, Problem Closure</a> if the specialist performed a good 
						analysis but was not able to propose a practical structural solution.<br>
						<br>
						If the specialist proposed a practical structural solution, but did not 
						implement it because he/she believed Change Management to be required, the 
						problem coordinator checks to see whether Change Management is really needed. 
						If this is not the case, the problem coordinator assigns the problem to the 
						most appropriate specialist to get the problem solved. If Change Management is 
						really required, the problem coordinator passes the problem to the change 
						coordinator of the affected service.<br>
						<br>
						If the analysis of the specialist is not acceptable, however, the problem 
						coordinator reassigns the problem to the same or another specialist for a 
						better analysis.</p>
