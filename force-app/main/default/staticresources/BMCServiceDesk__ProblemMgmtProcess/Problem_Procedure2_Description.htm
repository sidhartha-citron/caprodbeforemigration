    The specialist reviews the details of the
    problem. If the problem was identified
    after one or more incidents were
    already caused by it, the specialist attempts to provide a temporary
    workaround. The information about
    the workaround, and specifically how to implement it, is added to the problem. This
    workaround can be used to resolve future incidents caused by the problem until a
    structural solution has been found and implemented.<br>
    <br>
    The specialist subsequently starts to track down the
    root cause of the problem. After
    having found the root cause, the problem is updated with its description.<br>
    <br>
    Next, the specialist considers possible structural solutions and evaluates them.
    A description of each option is added to the problem along with the recommendation
    for the preferred structural solution.<br>
    <br>
    If Change Management is not required to permanently work around or remove the
    root cause, the specialist implements the preferred structural solution.<br>
    <br>
    If the specialist is not able to find the root cause or is not able to propose a
    structural solution, he/she specifies the reason in the problem.<br>
    <br>
    Regardless of whether a structural solution was proposed or even already implemented,
    the specialist updates the status of the problem to inform the problem coordinator
    that his/her work has been completed.</p></td>
