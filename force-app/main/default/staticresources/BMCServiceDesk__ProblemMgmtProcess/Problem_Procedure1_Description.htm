						The problem coordinator uses support request or&nbsp;incident&nbsp;information 
						to identify problems in the service(s)he/she is responsible for. The problem 
						coordinator's most important tools for identifying problems are the search and 
						reporting functionality of the service management application. A specialist can 
						also draw the attention of a problem coordinator to certain support requests 
						that, in the opinion of the specialist, represent a problem.<br>
						<br>
						After the identification of a problem, the problem coordinator registers the 
						problem in the service management application. The problem coordinator 
						subsequently selects the appropriate severity level and links the support 
						requests that were caused by the problem to it.<br>
						<br>
						The problem coordinator then assigns the problem to the most appropriate 
						specialist (in terms of skills, availability and access rights) for analysis.<br>
