These phases vary depending on how your organization configures and implements the possible changes. Depending on the type of incidents you have to resolve, you might require approvals from various stakeholders to implement changes and assign tasks to staff members. The approvers of incidents and change requests are defined in the approval processes created for the Incident and Change Request objects.</p>

An action record with the status of Submitted is created to indicate that the incident or change request has been submitted for approval. You can view the comments that are added when the incident or change request is submitted for approval or recalled by moving your mouse over the balloon icon in the <b class="cBold">Comment</b> column of the action record. An action record with the status of Pending is also created to indicate that approval is pending for the incident or change request. These action records display the assigned approver in the <b class="cBold">Assigned To</b> column and the actual approver in the <b class="cBold">Actual Approver</b> column. If the approval is completed by a delegated approver, the name of the delegated approver appears in the <b class="cBold">Actual Approver</b> column. If a queue is assigned as the approver in the approval process, the <b class="cBold">Assigned To</b> column displays the name of the assigned queue. When one of the members of the queue approves or rejects the incident or change request, the name of the member appears in the <b class="cBold">Actual Approver</b> column.
