If the solution to an incident involves more than one action, procedure, or process, consider dividing the solution into separate tasks. Dividing the solution into separate tasks can help you to manage and monitor the incident as it moves toward resolution. </p>
<a name="wp1077543"> </a><p class="pBody">You can create a task from an existing incident or directly using the task page. When you create a task from an incident, all the associated details of the incident such as client name, category, and description are filled in to the task form. The incident number is also copied to the task so that a staff member can see the incident that is related to the task. </p>
<a name="wp1077544"> </a><p class="pBody">For example, one of your clients calls a staff member to report that the common printer is not working. The staff member checks the printer and finds that the printer cartridge needs to be replaced. Additionally, the printer paper is getting over and would need to be purchased. The staff member creates an incident to record the issue of the printer not working. Next, the staff member creates the following tasks that must be completed to resolve the incident:</p>
