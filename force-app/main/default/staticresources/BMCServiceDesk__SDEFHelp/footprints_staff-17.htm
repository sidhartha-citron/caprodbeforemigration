</script><a name="wp1519195"> </a><p class="pBody">Alan is a client who uses Self Service to request software to be installed on his new laptop, a device in BMC Client Management. David is a staff member who works on completing software installation service requests that are submitted in Self Service. The following steps describe the flow of activities that occur to complete Alan’s service request to install Microsoft Office and Microsoft Visio in Self Service:</p>
<a name="wp1519196"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 1	In BMC Client Management, David creates one operational rule to install Microsoft Office and another operational rule to install Microsoft Visio. 
</p>
<a name="wp1519197"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 2	In the operational rule to install Microsoft Office, David sets the value of the <b class="cBold">Deployment from External Integration</b> property to <b class="cBold">Available in integrated solutions</b>. This operational rule is now available in BMC Remedyforce to create a Task template to deploy this operational rule.
</p>
<a name="wp1519201"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 3	In the operational rule to install Microsoft Visio, David sets the value of the <b class="cBold">Deployment from External Integration</b> property to <b class="cBold">Additional workflow needed</b> to ensure that the operational rule deployment occurs only after approval is received for the rule. This operational rule is now available in BMC Remedyforce to create a Task template to deploy the rule. 
</p>
<a name="wp1519208"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 4	In BMC Remedyforce, David creates an approval process for deploying operational rules. For more information, see <a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('BMC_Remedyforce_help', 'integration-09.htm');" onMouseOver="WWHShowPopup('BMC_Remedyforce_help', 'integration-09.htm', (document.all||document.getElementById||document.layers)?event:null);" onMouseOut="WWHHidePopup();">Creating an approval process for deploying operational rules</a>.
</p>
<a name="wp1519215"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 5	In BMC Remedyforce, David creates service request definitions for commonly occurring service requests, such as software installation requests for Microsoft Office and Microsoft Visio. In the Install Microsoft Office service request definition, David selects the Request Detail template that contains the required Incident template. In the Incident template, David links the Task template that deploys the operational rule to install Microsoft Office.
</p>
<a name="wp1519216"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 6	In the <b class="cBold">Install Microsoft Visio</b> service request definition, David selects the Request Detail template that contains the required Incident template. In the Incident template, David links the Task template that deploys the operational rule to install Microsoft Visio.
</p>
<a name="wp1519217"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 7	Alan logs on to Self Service and submits the <b class="cBold">Install Microsoft Office</b> service request. 
</p>
<a name="wp1519218"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 8	David is assigned to work on the service request. David opens the service request in BMC Remedyforce and links Alan&#39;s BMC Client Management device to the service request by clicking <b class="cBold">Link CI</b>, and double-clicking the device if it is present in the <b class="cBold">Remedyforce CMDB</b> tab (or <b class="cBold">Workspaces &gt; Configuration Management &gt; Configuration Items</b> page in the Visualforce page layout user interface). 
</p>
<a name="wp1545733"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
If the required device is not present in the <b class="cBold">Remedyforce CMDB</b> tab, David clicks the <b class="cBold">Asset Core</b> tab, searches for the device, and double-clicks it to link it to the service request. For more information, see <a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('BMC_Remedyforce_help', 'footprints_staff-14.htm');" onMouseOver="WWHShowPopup('BMC_Remedyforce_help', 'footprints_staff-14.htm', (document.all||document.getElementById||document.layers)?event:null);" onMouseOut="WWHHidePopup();">Searching for, importing, and linking a device to incidents or service requests</a>.
</p>
<a name="wp1519228"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 9	BMC Remedyforce creates a task for the operational rule and links the task to the current service request. You can track the progress of the operational rule deployment in the status of the task. If the operational rule deployment is executed successfully or failed, BMC Remedyforce records the details of the deployment in the <b class="cBold">Action History</b> tab for the task record and the linked device. 
</p>
<a name="wp1545743"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
If the operational rule deployment request was successfully completed, the status of the operational rule updates to Request Successful and the status of the task updates to the status you have assigned to Request Successful, such as COMPLETED. When the status of the task updates to the status you have assigned to Request Successful, Microsoft Office is installed on Alan’s device.
</p>
<a name="wp1519232"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 10	Alan logs on to Self Service and submits the <b class="cBold">Install Microsoft Visio</b> service request. 
</p>
<a name="wp1519233"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 11	David is assigned to work on the service request. David opens the service request in BMC Remedyforce and links Alan&#39;s BMC Client Management device to the service request by clicking <b class="cBold">Link CI</b>, and double-clicking the device if it is present in the <b class="cBold">Remedyforce CMDB</b> tab (or <b class="cBold">Workspaces &gt; Configuration Management &gt; Configuration Items</b> page in the Visualforce page layout user interface). 
</p>
<a name="wp1545767"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
If the required device is not present in the <b class="cBold">Remedyforce CMDB</b> tab, David clicks the <b class="cBold">Asset Core</b> tab, searches for the device, and double-clicks it to link it to the service request.

</p>
<a name="wp1519243"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 12	BMC Remedyforce creates a task for the operational rule and links the task to the current service request. 
</p>
<a name="wp1519244"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 13	An approval is required before deploying the operational rule to install Microsoft Visio. The current service request remains locked until the approver approves or rejects the approval. Also, the <b class="cBold">Asset Core Approval Status</b> field of the current service request is updated to <b class="cBold">Pending Approval</b>. When the approval is received, the <b class="cBold">Asset Core Approval Status</b> field is updated to <b class="cBold">Approved</b>. 
</p>
<a name="wp1519245"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 14	After the approval is received, the service request is unlocked and the task to deploy the operational rule runs.
</p>
<a name="wp1519246"> </a><p class="pOverviewStep">
	Step 15	You can track the progress of the operational rule deployment in the status of the task. If the operational rule deployment is executed successfully or failed, BMC Remedyforce records the details of the deployment in the Action History tab for the task record and the linked device. If the operational rule deployment request was successfully completed, the status of the operational rule updates to Request Successful and the status of the task updates to the status you have assigned to Request Successful, such as COMPLETED. When the status of the task updates to the status you have assigned to Request Successful, such as COMPLETED, Microsoft Visio is installed on Alan’s device.
