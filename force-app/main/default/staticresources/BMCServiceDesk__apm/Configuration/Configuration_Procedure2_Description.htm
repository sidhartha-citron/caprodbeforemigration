<h1>Procedure 2, CI Receipt</h1>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="576">

    <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left"><p><br>
        If the task from Change Management or Request Management does not add 
        new <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CI">CIs</a> to the 
        <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CMDB">CMDB</a>, the configuration administrator 
        goes directly to <a href="Configuration_Procedure4_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 
        4, CI Update</a>.<br>
    <br>
        On the other hand, if the task requests the registration of one or more 
        CIs for which a formal purchase requisition was not submitted (for example, in 
        the case of internally developed software), or if one or more new CIs 
        have been ordered, the configuration administrator first checks the CIs 
        after they have been delivered. The configuration administrator does this to ensure that the correct 
        hardware, software, and software license certificates have been received, 
        that no items are missing, and that the CIs are not damaged. If the 
        delivery is not whole, the configuration administrator informs the supplier 
        and subsequently informs the change coordinator of the delay by updating 
        the task.<br>
    <br>
    Conversely, if the CIs have been received in good condition, the configuration
    administrator checks the service management application to see if the contact details
    of the supplier are up to date.  If the supplier of the CIs has not yet been registered,
    or if its contact details are no longer up to date, the configuration administrator
    ensures that the supplier information is registered or updated in
    <a href="Configuration_Procedure3_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 3, Supplier Information Maintenance</a>.<br>
    <br>
        After updating or registering the supplier information, the configuration administrator updates the status of the 
        new CIs and adds any missing information (for example, the serial number) if 
        the CIs are already registered in <a href="Configuration_Procedure1_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 
        1, CI Requisition</a>. If a formal purchase requisition is not submitted 
        for the new CIs; however, the configuration administrator registers the 
        new CIs in the CMDB. The configuration administrator ensures that all 
        attributes of the new CIs and the links between the new CIs and other 
        CIs, <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">services</a> and <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#User">users</a> 
        are correctly registered.<br>
    <br>
    Having ensured that the new CIs are properly registered in the CMDB, the configuration
    administrator attaches a label with the CI code to each new CI when applicable.</p></td>
