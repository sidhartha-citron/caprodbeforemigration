    When the next <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CAB">CAB</a> meeting for a
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> is due, the release coordinator
    of the service sends the invitations to the service's CAB staff members. In the invitation, the
    release coordinator specifies the deadline until which change requests can be submitted for
    review during the next CAB meeting. After the change request submission deadline has passed, the
    release coordinator finalizes the list of change requests that would be reviewed during the next
    CAB meeting and sends it to the CAB staff members so that they can discuss the change requests
    internally before the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    The finalized list of change requests is reviewed during the meeting. After all change requests
    have been reviewed, each CAB Staff member lets the release coordinator know which change requests
     need to be rejected and which change requests would be included in
    the next <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Release">release</a>. A change request is rejected
    when at least two-thirds of the CAB staff members agree that it should be rejected. Similarly, a
    change request is included in the next release when two-thirds or more of the CAB staff members have
    asked for it to be included. Change requests that are neither rejected nor included in the next
    release are reviewed again during the next CAB meeting. Before closing the CAB meeting, the
    CAB staff members agree on the date, time, and location of the next CAB meeting.<br>
    <br>
    After the CAB meeting, the release coordinator ensures that the requesters of the rejected change
    requests are informed by completing these change requests. Having done this, the release coordinator
    publishes the notes of the CAB meeting and registers the new release. The release coordinator links a change for the coordination of the release and links the change requests that are to
    be included in the release to this change.<br>
    <br>
    The release coordinator then reviews these change requests with the change coordinator of the
    service for which the release is to be implemented and the change coordinators of the supporting
    services that also need to be changed. Together they divide the requirements of the
    different change requests amongst them and they draft a high-level implementation plan
    that indicates the duration of each change, and the dependencies between these changes.</p></td>
