<h1>Procedure 3, Business Justification</h1>

    If an approved business case is not required for the
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Release">release</a>, the release coordinator cancels the
    business justification work order that is part of the change to which the change requests of
    the release are linked. On the other hand, if the next release cannot be implemented using
    the <nobr>budgets </nobr> already available to the service owner, the release coordinator
    prepares a business case to justify the release. Having prepared the business case, the
    release coordinator requests approval for the business case to ensure that a budget is
    made available for the implementation of the new release.<br>
    <br>
    If the business case is rejected, the release coordinator adjusts it if this could still
    get the business case approved. If it is not possible to get the business case approved, the
    release coordinator lets the requesters of the release know that the business case for the
    release has been rejected. If the release was defined by the
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CAB">CAB</a>, the release coordinator moves the change
    requests that are linked to the release back to the change that acts as the placeholder for
    change requests that are to be reviewed during the next CAB meeting. Before closing the
    release, the release coordinator also contacts the CAB staff members to inform them that the
    business case of their release has been rejected and gives them the option to bring the next
    CAB meeting forward.</p></td>
