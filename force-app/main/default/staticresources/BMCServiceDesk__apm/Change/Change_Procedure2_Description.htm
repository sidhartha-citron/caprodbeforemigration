      After registering the change, the  change coordinator starts the risk and impact analysis phase. During this  phase, the change coordinator gathers the information needed to create a change implementation plan that minimizes the risk of failure and the impact  on the customers.<br>
        <br>
        The change coordinator creates a separate risk and impact task (Change Assessment) for each 
        question that needs to be answered.<br>
        <br>
        In case of a new <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#service instance">service instance</a> or modification of an existing service instance in order to fulfil the change requirements, the change 
        coordinator also assigns a risk and impact task to the availability 
        manager for the creation of a new, or  modification of an existing 
        service instance design.<br>
        <br>Risk and impact tasks that the change coordinator cannot answer are assigned to the most appropriate specialist within  the change coordinator's group, or to another group.</p>
      <p>Using the answers for the risk and impact  tasks (Change Assessment), the change coordinator adjusts the implementation plan that was copied from the template  when registering the change. </p></td>
