    After the implementation is completed, the  specialist (with the help of a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#User">user</a>, if the specialist does not have sufficient  access rights) performs a test in the production  environment to verify the success of the implementation.  If the implementation is unsuccessful, the specialist contacts the service  owner (or on-duty manager, if the service owner is not available) to discuss  the situation.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if the implementation is successful,  the specialist completes the support request. In addition, the specialist asks  the change coordinator of the affected service to register the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Emergency change">emergency 
      change</a>.</p>
      <p>The change coordinator registers the change and  ensures that the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CMDB">CMDB</a> is updated if &nbsp;necessary. Then, the change<br>
        coordinator informs the service owner that the  emergency change was implemented successfully. Finally, the change coordinator  closes the emergency request.</p>
