    When the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#SLA">SLAs</a> of one of the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Customer">customer</a> organization of the service level manager
    have reached the end
    of their evaluation term, the service level manager schedules a meeting with the representative for this customer.
    Next, the service level manager determines the actual level at which the
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">services</a> have been provided over the past term
    to the customer of the SLAs.<br>
    <br>
    The service level manager subsequently compares the actual service levels with the service
    level targets (<a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#SLT">SLTs</a>) specified in the SLAs. If
    one or more SLTs are violated during the evaluation term, the service level manager contacts
    the responsible service owners to find out why the SLTs are violated and how the service
    owners can ensure that these SLTs are not violated again. The service level manager
    uses all this information, along with their proactive improvement suggestions, to compile a
    detailed report for the customer representative.<br>
    <br>
    The service level manager reviews the report with the customer representative, preferably within
    one month after the end of the evaluation term. During the meeting the customer representative
    informs the service level managers of any requests from the customer organization that they
    represent.<br>
    <br>
        After the meeting, the requests are registered as requests by the service 
        level manager and passed to the most appropriate group. The service level 
        manager then documents the minutes of the meeting and references the numbers 
        of these requests. The meeting notes are distributed to the customer representative, 
        concerned service owners, and service desk manager.<br>
    <br>
    Ad hoc requests from customer representatives are also registered by the service level manager
    and passed to the most appropriate group.</p></td>
