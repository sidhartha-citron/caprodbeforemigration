        If the task for the Service Level Management requests the discontinuation 
        of a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Catalog item">catalog item</a>, 
        the service level administrator ensures that it can no longer 
        be accessed by <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Customer">customers</a> from the web-based <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service catalog">service 
        catalog</a> of the service provider organization.<br>
    <br>
        If the task requests the termination of one or more <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#SLA">SLAs</a>, 
        the service level administrator updates the status of these SLAs to indicate 
        that the SLAs have been discontinued. In addition, the service level administrator 
        checks the status of the other SLAs that are linked to the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">services</a> 
        which SLAs the administrator has discontinued. If all SLAs linked to these services 
        are now discontinued, the service level administrator also discontinues 
        these services by updating their status.<br>
    <br>
        When no further action is required from the service level administrator 
        to update the Service Level Management information, the administrator 
        updates the task to inform the success or failure to the change coordinator (for example, the requested catalog item was not approved or the requested 
        SLA was not signed).</p></td>
