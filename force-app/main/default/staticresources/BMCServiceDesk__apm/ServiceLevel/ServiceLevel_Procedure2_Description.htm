        If the task for the Service Level Management requests the registration 
        of a new <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#service instance">service instance</a>, the service level administrator fills the <a href="../Forms/Service.htm">Service</a> 
        form in the service management application.<br>
    <br>
        If the task requests the preparation of a new <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#SLA">SLA</a>, 
        the service level administrator prepares a new SLA by filling out the 
        <a href="../ProcessDocuments/Service_Level_Agreement_Template.doc" target="_blank">Service 
        Level Agreement Template</a>, printing two copies, and attaching a printout 
        of the relevant catalog item to each copy. The service level administrator 
        then collects the signatures of both the customer representative and the 
        service owner who are responsible for meeting the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#SLT">SLTs</a> 
        specified in the SLA.<br>
    <br>
        If either the customer representative or the service owner decided not 
        to sign the SLA, the service level administrator goes to <a href="ServiceLevel_Procedure4_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 
        4, Service Termination</a> to mention the reason of not establishing the new SLA in the task. If the new SLA was signed, the 
        service level administrator files one copy of the signed SLA and returns 
        the other to the customer representative for their files.<br>
    <br>
    Before registering a new SLA, the service level administrator checks the service management
    application to see if the contact details of the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Customer">customer</a>
    are up to date. If the customer of the SLA has not yet been registered, or if the contact details
    of the customer are no longer up to date, the service level administrator ensures that the customer
    information is registered or updated in
    <a href="ServiceLevel_Procedure3_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 3, Customer Information Maintenance</a>.<br>
    <br>
    When the contact details of the customer are latest, the service level administrator registers the
    new SLA in the service management application and links it to the
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#service instance">service instance</a> that is
    used to provide the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> to the customer.</p></td>
