<h1>Procedure 1: Request Registration</h1>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="576">

    <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left"><p><br>
        When a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#User">user</a> contacts the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service desk">service 
        desk</a>, the service desk analyst links the user's  record to a 
        new request. Next, the service desk analyst determines the nature of the 
        user's request by asking the user how the service desk analyst can help the user if the user contacted the service desk by phone or in person. If the user contacted the service desk in writing (for example, email, 
        fax, paper form, and so on), the service desk analyst determines the nature 
        of the request by reading through the information.<br>
    <br>
        If the user contacted the service desk about an earlier submitted request, 
        the service desk analyst searches for the request. If the request is already completed 
        or set to ClosedMail, but the user is not satisfied with the solution 
        provided, the service desk analyst sets the status to assigned. The request appears in the To Do list of the staff and group that provided 
        the original solution. If the user wants an 
        update on the request's status, the service desk analyst informs the user 
        of the progress.<br>
    <br>
        If the user contacted the service desk to submit a new request, the service 
        desk analyst determines if a request template is available 
        for the request.<br>
    <br>
        If a request template is available, the service desk analyst uses the 
        template to create the request. The service desk analyst reads the instructions 
        from the template and follows them. The instructions specify the information 
        to obtain from the user and how to proceed after receiving the information (for example, how to resolve the request, or assign to which group).<br>
    <br>
        If a request template is not available for the request, 
        the service desk analyst creates the request. 
        The service desk analyst links the applicable <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> 
        and <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CI">configuration item</a>        to the request.<br>
    <br>
        If the user reports an <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Incident">incident</a>, 
        the service desk analyst determines the impact and urgency 
        level based on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Information provided by the user</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Information about 
            the configuration of the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#service instance">service 
              instance</a> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Other incidents that are currently open for the 
            impacted service</p>
        </li>
      </ul>      
      <p>The impact and urgency level  determine 
        the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Priority">priority</a> level that 
        is assigned to requests for incident resolution. <br>
        <br>
        If the user reports that a critical or core service has failed for several users, the service desk analyst
        escalates the incident to the service owner. 
        The service owner activates the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Major Incident Team">Major Incident Team</a> to  resolve the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Major Incident">Major Incident</a>. </p></td>
