        requests.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Request Registration is used by service desk analysts when they register requests from <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#User">users</a>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Request Assignment is used by service 
            desk analysts when they assign requests to groups 
            and to the service desk manager in case of complaints and compliments. 
            Service 
            desk analysts also use this procedure when they handle requests that are rejected by group coordinators. Group coordinators use this procedure 
            after requests are assigned to their  groups. Group coordinators  use 
            this procedure 
            to assign these requests to a specific change coordinator or specialist 
            for resolution. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Compliment and Complaint Handling is used by the service desk manager when the service desk manager satisfactorily completes requests 
            of the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Complaint">Complaint</a> or Compliment categories. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Request Tracking is used by service desk 
            analysts when they track the progress of requests. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Request Resolution by Specialist is used by specialists to complete assigned 
            requests. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Request Fulfillment Handling is used by service desk analysts or specialists to complete requests 
            that can be handled by using a predefined workflow. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Incident Escalation Handling is used by service owners when an <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Incident">incident</a> is <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Escalate">escalated</a>. The service owner of the affected <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> uses this procedure to determine how the
            incident can be efficiently resolved. </p>
        </li>
        <li>         
          <p> Request Closure is used by service desk analysts when they resolve and close 
            completed requests.</p>
