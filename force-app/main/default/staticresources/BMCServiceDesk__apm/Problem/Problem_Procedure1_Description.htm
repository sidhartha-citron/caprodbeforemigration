        The problem coordinator uses request information to identify <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Problem">problems</a> 
        in the assigned <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">services</a>.The problem coordinator can  
        identify problems by using the  search and reporting functionality of the 
        service management application. A specialist can inform the problem coordinator about certain requests that, in the opinion of the 
        specialist, represent a problem.</p>
      <p>        After the identification of a problem, the problem coordinator registers 
        the problem in the service management application. The problem coordinator 
        subsequently selects the appropriate impact and urgency level and links 
        the requests that were caused by the problem.<br>
        <br>
        The problem coordinator  assigns the problem to the most appropriate specialist (in
        terms of skills, availability and access rights) for <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Root cause analysis">analysis</a>.<br>
        <br>
        The <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service desk">service desk</a> can 
        be automatically informed through email that a new problem has been identified 
        after the problem has been saved.<br>
        <br>
        When the problem coordinator finds requests that have not yet been linked 
        to a problem, but which were caused by a previously identified problem, the problem coordinator  links these requests to the problem.</p></td>
