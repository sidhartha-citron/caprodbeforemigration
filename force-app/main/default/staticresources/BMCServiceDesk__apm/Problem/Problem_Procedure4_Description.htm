        After a change has been implemented to provide a structural solution for 
        the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Problem">problem</a>, the problem 
        coordinator verifies whether  the change has actually solved the 
        problem.<br>
        <br>
        If the implementation appears to have solved the problem, the problem 
        coordinator closes it. If the problem was reactively identified, the service 
        management application subsequently informs the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service desk">service 
        desk</a> through an email message that it has been removed from the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a>.</p>
      <p> On the other hand, if the change was not implemented, or if the implementation 
        did not fix the problem, the problem coordinator determines if it is  possible to propose a different structural solution for the problem. 
        If yes, the problem coordinator reassigns the problem 
        to a specialist within the group.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively, if it is clear that there is currently no practical means 
        available to permanently work around or remove the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Root cause">root 
        cause</a>, the problem coordinator updates the problem to indicate the 
        impasse. Periodically, the problem coordinator will  check for new 
        possibilities and  ask for another <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Root cause analysis">analysis</a> 
        when it is likely that a new or different approach or technology could 
        provide a practical structural solution.</p>
      <p>If the solution or workaround to the problem needs to be available in the 
        knowledge base, a new knowledge article is created.</p>
