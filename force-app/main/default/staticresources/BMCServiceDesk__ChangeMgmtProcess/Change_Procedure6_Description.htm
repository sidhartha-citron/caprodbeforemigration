      <p>If the specialist determines that all the requirements of the change  have been met, the  CMDB, the Capacity  Management, and the Continuity Management information is updated  as needed. The change coordinator subsequently informs the requesters and approvers of the change that the  change has been implemented successfully. Then, the change  coordinator closes the change request. </p>
      <p>If all the requirements have not been met, however,  the specialist who performed the production test determines whether  the change must be rolled back. If the change  does not provide  an improvement over the previous  situation or causes a security  or data integrity risk, the change is rolled back. </p>
      <p>If the implementation can still be successful, the change coordinator creates the necessary  additional tasks. However, if it is not clear how all change requirements can be met, the change  coordinator informs the requesters and approvers of the situation  and closes the change request. </p></td>
