If the implementation is unsuccessful, the specialist contacts the service  owner (or on-duty manager, if the service owner is not available) to discuss  the situation.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if the implementation is successful,  the specialist completes the support request. In addition, the specialist asks  the change coordinator of the affected service to register the emergency  change.</p>

        coordinator informs the service owner that the  emergency change was implemented successfully. Finally, the change coordinator  closes the emergency request.</p>
