If the change conflicts with internal standards or policies, the change manager informs the change  coordinator that the change cannot  be implemented. </p>
      <p>If the change does not  conflict with internal  standards or policies,  the change manager  reviews the risk and impact  analysis and the implementation plan. The change  manager verifies that appropriate precautions have been planned to minimize the risk of failure and the impact  on customers, and that the timing of the implementation does not conflict  with other planned  changes or planned  events. </p>
      <p>If the risk and impact analysis  is insufficient, the change manager  requests additional analysis  from the change coordinator. If the planning  does not adequately address the risk of failure  or the impact on the customers, or if the planning conflicts  with other planned  changes or events,  the change manager  requests an adjustment of the implementation plan from the change coordinator. </p>
      <p>If the risk and impact  analysis and the planning of the implementation are acceptable, the change manager determines the approval  that is required for the change. Approval is required from the representatives of customers who will be affected by the change  implementation if the implementation causes either of the  following conditions: </p>

    <p>If these conditions do not apply to the planned implementation,  approval from the service owner is sufficient. </p>
    <p>If the change is rejected by an approver,  the change manager  finds the reason. If appropriate, the change manager asks the change  coordinator to perform  additional risk and impact analysis  or to adjust the planning. </p>
