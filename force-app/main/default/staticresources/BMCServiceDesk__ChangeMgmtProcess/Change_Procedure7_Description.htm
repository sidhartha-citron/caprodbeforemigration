      After the service owner (or  on-duty manager, if the service owner is not available) has asked a specialist  to resolve an incident by implementing an emergency change,  the specialist starts  work on the implementation. If the emergency  change is an infrastructure change, the specialist performs  the implementation as if completing a normal  support request. </p>
      <p>If the emergency change  is an application change, the specialist builds a new release in the development  environment and ensures  that it will fix the incident without  introducing new issues.  The specialist subsequently asks a release  administrator to transfer  the new release to the test environment. In the test environment, the specialist tests  the new release. </p>
      <p>If the new release does not pass testing, the specialist goes back to the development environment to correct  it. If the new release  passes testing, the specialist asks the release  administrator to transfer  it to the production environment.</p>
