        If an implementation task must be completed by another group, work with the coordinator of the group  to determine the most appropriate member (in terms of skills,  availability, and access  rights) to do the work and agree on a realistic completion target. Select this person  by using the <strong>Assign To</strong> option of the toolbar. However,  if the group coordinator does not yet know who should complete the task, use the <strong>Assign To</strong> <strong>Queue</strong> option to select only  the group's queue.  In that case, the group coordinator can select the most appropriate person in the <strong>Staff</strong> field after the task's status has been set to Assigned.<br>
        <br>
        If an implementation task must be completed by an external  organization, work with your contact person at this organization  to determine  a realistic implementation target. Use the <strong>Assign To</strong> option to select yourself  in the <strong>Staff</strong> field of the task and add  a Notes action record about the external organization that will be asked to do the work. Later,  when the work can start, inform  the supplier and enter the reference number under which the supplier has  registered this assignment in the same Notes action record. </p></td>
