        If an implementation task must be completed by another group, work with the coordinator of the group to determine the most appropriate member (in terms of skills,  availability, and access  rights) to do the work and agree on a realistic completion target. Select this  person by using the <strong>Assign To</strong> option of the toolbar. However, if the group coordinator does not yet know who should  complete the task, use  the <strong>Assign To Queue</strong> option to select only the group&rsquo;s queue. In that case, the group coordinator can select the most appropriate person in the <strong>Staff</strong> field after the task's status has been set to <strong>Assigned</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        If an implementation task must completed  by an external organization, work with your contact person at this organization  to determine  a realistic implementation target. Use the <strong>Assign To</strong> option of the toolbar  to assign the task  to yourself and add a Notes  action record about  the external organization  that will be asked to do the work. Later,  when the work can start, inform the supplier and enter the reference number under which  the supplier has registered this assignment in the same Notes action record. </p></td>
