        If  an implementation task must be completed by another group, work with the  coordinator of the group to determine the most appropriate member (in terms of  skills, availability, and access rights) to do the work and agree on a  realistic completion target. Select this person by using the <strong>Assign To</strong> option of the toolbar.  However, if the group coordinator does not yet know who should complete the  task, use the <strong>Assign To Queue</strong> option  to select only the group&rsquo;s queue. In that case, the group coordinator can select  the most appropriate person in the Staff field after the task's status has been  set to Assigned.<br>
        <br>
        If an implementation task must  completed by an external organization, work with your contact person at this  organization to determine a realistic implementation target. Use the <strong>Assign To</strong> option of the toolbar to  assign the task to yourself and add a Notes action record about the external  organization that will be asked to do the work. Later, when the work can start,  inform the supplier and enter the reference number under which the supplier has  registered this assignment in the same Notes action record.</p></td>
