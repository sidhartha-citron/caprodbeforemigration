    The change coordinator  receives change  requests for the services for which they coordinate changes. The change requests can originate from the  following sources: </p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="justify"><p class="bullet">Incident Management, in the form of
        support requests,</p></td>

        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="justify"><p class="bullet">Problem Management, in the form of
        problems with the status &quot;Change Requested&quot;,</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Upon receiving a change  request, the change  coordinator determines whether  it can be added to a change  that has already been registered. If so, the change  coordinator links the change request  to the existing change. </p>
    <p>If the change request  asks for the implementation of a standard  change, the change  coordinator uses the change template  that was created for the standard change  to register a new change,  and links the request to it. The change coordinator subsequently follows the workflow that was copied  from the template  to implement the change. </p>
    <p>If the change request  is not a request for a standard  change, the change  coordinator verifies whether the request conflicts  with internal standards or policies. If it does conflict, the change request  is rejected and the requester  is informed of the relevant internal standard or policy. </p>
    <p>If no conflict exists, the change coordinator determines whether the change implementation needs to be coordinated by Change Management. This coordination is necessary only when  the implementation has one of the following effects:

      <tr>

        unavailable or
        degraded during
        service hours,</p></td>

        <td class="bullet"></td>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If the change can be implemented without the involvement of Change Management, the change
    coordinator rejects the change request and informs the requester that Change Management is not
    required.<br>
    <br>
    If Change Management is required for the implementation of the requested  change, the change  coordinator registers a new change  and links the requirements of the request to it.</p>
