  After registering the change, the  change coordinator starts the risk and impact analysis phase. During this  phase, the change coordinator gathers the information needed to create a change implementation plan that minimizes the risk of failure and the impact  on the 
customers.</p>
      <p>The change coordinator creates  a separate risk and impact  task (Change Assessment) for each question  that needs to be answered.  Whenever the change  coordinator can answer a question, the coordinator completes the risk and impact  task (Change Assessment). Risk and impact  tasks that the change coordinator cannot answer are assigned to the most appropriate specialist within  the change coordinator's group, or to another group. </p>
      <p>Using the answers for the risk and impact  tasks (Change Assessment), the change coordinator adjusts the implementation plan that was copied from the template  when registering the change. </p></td>
