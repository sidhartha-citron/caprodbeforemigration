    After a specialist has completed the
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Root cause analysis">root cause analysis</a> of a
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Problem">problem</a>, the problem coordinator reviews the
    results to determine if a structural solution has been proposed or has been implemented
    already. If the specialist has already solved the problem because Change Management was
    not required to coordinate the implementation of the structural solution, the problem
    coordinator goes directly to
    <a href="Problem_Procedure4_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 4, Problem Closure</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The problem coordinator also goes to 
    <a href="Problem_Procedure4_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 4, Problem Closure</a>
    if the specialist performed a good analysis but was not able to propose a practical structural
    solution.<br>
    <br>
    If the specialist proposed a practical structural solution, but did not implement it because
    they believed Change Management to be required, the problem coordinator checks to see whether
    Change Management is  needed. If this is not the case, the problem coordinator assigns
    the problem to the most appropriate specialist to get the problem solved. If Change Management
    is  required, the problem coordinator passes the problem to the change coordinator of the
    affected <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a>.<br>
    <br>
    If the analysis of the specialist is not acceptable, however, the problem coordinator reassigns
    the problem to the same or another specialist for a better analysis.</p></td>
