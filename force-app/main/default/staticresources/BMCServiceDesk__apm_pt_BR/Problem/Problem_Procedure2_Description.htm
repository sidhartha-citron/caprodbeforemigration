        The specialist reviews the details of the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Problem">problem</a>. 
        If the problem was identified after one or more <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Incident">incidents</a> 
        were created by it, the specialist attempts to provide a  
        <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Workaround">workaround</a>. A  knowledge article is created that contains the information about the workaround and how to implement the workaround. A reference to the article is added to the problem. </p>
      <p>This workaround can be used to resolve future incidents caused 
        by the problem until a structural solution has been found and implemented.<br>
        <br>Once the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Root cause">root 
          cause</a> analysis is done by the specialist, the problem 
      is updated with its description.</p>
      <p>Next, the specialist considers possible structural solutions and evaluates 
        them. A description of each option is added to the problem along with 
        the recommendation for the preferred structural solution.<br>
        <br>
        If Change Management is not required to  remove 
        the root cause, the specialist implements the preferred structural solution.<br>
        <br>
        If the specialist is not able to find the root cause or is not able to 
        propose a structural solution, the specialist mentions the reason in the problem.<br>
        <br>
        Regardless of whether a structural solution was proposed or even already 
        implemented, the specialist updates the status of the problem to inform 
      the problem coordinator that the work has been completed.</p>
