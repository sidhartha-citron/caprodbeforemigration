    If the work order requests the registration of a new, or the update of an existing, support
    contract, the configuration administrator checks to see if the supplier of the support contract has
    already been registered in the service management application. If the supplier organization
    of the support contract has already been registered, the configuration administrator checks
    the registered contact details to see if they are up to date. If the supplier organization of the support contract is not registered, or if its contact details are no longer up to date,
    the configuration administrator ensures that the supplier information is registered or updated
    by following
    <a href="Configuration_Procedure3_Frames.htm" target="_parent">Procedure 3, Supplier Information Maintenance</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Having ensured that the contact details of the supplier of the support contract are registered
    and up to date, the configuration administrator registers or updates the support contract in
    accordance with the field utilization guidelines for the
    <a href="../Forms/Contract.htm">Contract</a> form.<br>
    <br>
    Having completed the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CMDB">CMDB</a> update, the
    configuration administrator updates the work order with a summary of the modifications that were
    made.</p></td>
