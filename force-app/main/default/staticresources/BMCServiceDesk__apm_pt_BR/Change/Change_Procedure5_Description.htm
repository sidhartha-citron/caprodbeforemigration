    <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left"><p><br>After the first implementation tasks of the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Application change">application 
      change</a>  have been assigned,  one or more specialists develop  the new release in the development environment. The new release  is tested by the specialists to ensure that the change  requirements have been met. If a separate  test environment is available for testing,  the test are performed there. Otherwise, the tests are  performed in the development environment. If (automated) scripts  for <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Regression testing">regression 
      testing</a>  are available for the application, the specialists update  and run them. The specialists fix any errors that occurred  during the tests in the development environment. </p>
      <p>After the specialists confirm  that the change requirements have been met and that no new issues (<a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Bug">bugs</a>) have been introduced,  the release administrator transfers the new release to the test environment where the customer  representatives test it. </p>
      <p>If the new release  does not pass customer testing, the change coordinator creates  and assigns additional tasks to correct the release.  If these additional tasks cause the transfer to production to be rescheduled, the change must be approved  again. </p>
      <p>After the new release  has passed customer  testing, the specialists ensure <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Operational readiness">operational readiness</a> (that is, the new release  is ready to put into production). This readiness  could include <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#User">user</a> training, adding  storage capacity to the production  and continuity environments, and ordering additional software  licenses. </p>
      <p>Finally, the release  administrator transfers the new release  to production.</p>
