              staff (in terms of skills, availability, and access rights) to 
              do the work and agree on a realistic completion date. Select the 
              person in the <strong>Owner</strong> field of the task. However, if the group coordinator 
              does not yet know who  should complete the task, 
              select the queue in the <strong>Owner</strong> field. In that case, the group 
              coordinator can select the most appropriate staff in the <strong>Owner</strong> field 
              after the status of the task is set to <strong>Assigned</strong>.<br>

              If an implementation task must be completed by an external organization, 
              work with your contact person at this organization to determine 
              a realistic implementation date. Select yourself in the <strong>Owner</strong>              field of the task and add a Notes action to specify the external 
              organization that will be asked to do the work. Later, when the 
              work can start, inform the supplier and enter the reference number 
              under which the supplier has registered this assignment, in the 
              same Notes action record.</p></td>
