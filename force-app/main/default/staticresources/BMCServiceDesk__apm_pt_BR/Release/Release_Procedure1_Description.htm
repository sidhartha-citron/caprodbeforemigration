    After a change coordinator of a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> has passed
    a change request to the release coordinator of a service, the release coordinator reviews the
    request to gain an understanding of its requirements. The release coordinator passes the change
    request back to the change coordinator if it does not require the involvement of Release
    Management. Only the change requests that require implementation of a
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Non-standard change">non-standard change</a> must be handled by
    Release Management, with the exception of change requests that have been submitted for the
    prevention or fix of a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Problem">problem</a>, provided that
    the implementation of such change requests:</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">can be coordinated by a single
        change coordinator</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">does not cause the
        <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Functionality">functionality</a> of a
        service to become different</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><p class="bullet">does not require any additional
        funding</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If the change request does require the involvement of Release Management, the release coordinator
    checks to see if it requires <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CAB">CAB</a> approval. The CAB
    does not need to review the change request if it required the implementation of a change to
    prevent or fix a problem and if this change does not cause the functionality of a service to
    become different. If CAB approval is required, however, the release coordinator adds the change
    request to the list of requests that are waiting to be reviewed during the next meeting of the
    service's CAB.</p></td>
