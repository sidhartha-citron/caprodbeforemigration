<h1>Procedure 4, Release Coordination</h1>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="576">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left"><p><br>
    The release coordinator prepares a document for each change coordinator that details the
    release requirements that the change coordinator will be responsible for. The release
    coordinator sends the requirement documents to the change coordinators and ensures that
    the requested changes are registered and linked to the release.<br>
    <br>
    When a change coordinator has informed the release coordinator that one of the release's
    changes has been completed, the release coordinator enters a short update in the release.<br>
    <br>
    If the change could not be implemented successfully, the release coordinator works with the
    coordinators of the change requests that are linked to the release to determine how the (partial)
    failure of the change implementation affects the overall implementation of the release. If
    it is still possible to implement one or more additional changes to ensure that all or most
    requirements of the release are fulfilled, or if one or more additional changes are
    required to ensure that the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Rollback">rollback</a> of the
    release is completed, the release coordinator documents the requirements for the additional
    changes before passing them to the appropriate change coordinators.<br>
    <br>
    After the last change that a change coordinator was asked to get implemented for the release
    has been completed, the release coordinator ensures that the requesters are informed whether
    or not their requirements were fulfilled by the release implementation. If the release was
    defined by the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CAB">CAB</a>, the release coordinator moves
    any change requests whose requirements were not fully met back to the change that acts as the
    placeholder for change requests that are to be reviewed during the next CAB meeting. The
    release coordinator also informs the CAB staff members (if the release was defined by them) and the
    approvers of the business case (if one had to be prepared for the release).<br>
    <br>
    Having updated the requesters and approvers of the release, the release coordinator continues
    by organizing and conducting the post-implementation meeting. During this meeting, the release
    coordinator reviews the entire lifecycle of the release with the service owner of the
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> for which the release was implemented
    and the change coordinators who coordinated one or more change requests of the release. After the
    meeting, the release coordinator publishes the improvement suggestions and decisions that were
    agreed on by the attendees of the meeting. Finally, the release coordinator closes the release.</p></td>
