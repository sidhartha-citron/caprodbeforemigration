          <p> Release Definition is used by release coordinators to organize <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CAB">CAB</a> meetings and by CAB staff members when they decide which of the change requests that have
            been collected for CAB review should be fulfilled by the next release. Release
            coordinators also use this procedure to split the requirements of releases into logical
            groups that can be handled efficiently by change coordinators.</p>
        </li>
        <li>         
          <p>Business Justification is used by the
            release coordinators when additional funding needs to be obtained for the
        implementation of a release.</p>

        <li>
          <p>          Release Coordination is used by release coordinators
