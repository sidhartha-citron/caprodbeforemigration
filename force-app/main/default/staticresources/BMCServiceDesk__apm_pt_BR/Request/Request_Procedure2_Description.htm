<h1>Procedure 2: Request Assignment</h1>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="576">

    <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left"><p><br>
        If the request is a complaint or compliment, the service desk analyst 
        assigns the request to the service desk manager.<br>
	<br>
        If request fulfillment can handle a request, the service desk analyst 
        coordinates  implementing the request.<br>
	<br>
        The service desk analyst 
        considers all request categories for resolution. If the service desk analyst cannot resolve the 
        request (in terms of skills, access rights, and time restrictions), the service desk analyst 
         
        assigns the request to the appropriate group.
    </p>
      <p>The coordinator of the group reviews all requests that are assigned to a group by service desk analysts, 
        operators, continuity managers, and <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#User">users</a> and customer representatives who submit a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Web request form">web 
          request form</a>.<br>
        <br>
        If the group coordinator determines that a request is assigned to 
        the wrong group or the request does not contain all information that 
        should be provided by the service desk analyst, operator, or continuity 
        manager to complete it,  the group coordinator rejects the request and specifies 
        the reason for rejection.<br>
        <br>
        Rejected requests are automatically passed to the service desk. A service desk analyst ensures that the missing information is collected 
        and these rejected requests are reassigned to the appropriate 
        group if the service desk cannot resolve them.<br>
        <br>
        After requests are assigned to the correct group, the requests with the required information are passed to the change coordinator of the 
        related <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> if the requests are for a change whose implementation is coordinated by 
        Change Management. All other requests are assigned  to the appropriate 
      specialist of the group (in terms of skills, availability, and access rights).</p></td>
