<h1>Procedure 7: Incident Escalation Handling</h1>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="576">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left"><p><br>
    After a specialist or a service desk analyst has
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Escalate">escalated</a> an
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Incident">incident</a>, the owner of the affected
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service">service</a> talks to the specialists who have
    been dealing with the incident to understand the current situation and determine how the incident can be resolved.<br> 
    <br>
    If the incident is a <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Major incident">major incident,</a>    the service owner activates the <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Major incident team">Major Incident team</a>. 
    The <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Major incident team leader">Major Incident team leader</a> 
    is responsible for coordinating the resolution.<br>
    <br>
    If the recovery of the affected service
    at its <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Continuity site">continuity site</a> is the most
    efficient and reliable way to resolve the incident, the service owner escalates the
    incident to the on-duty manager to start the service recovery.<br>
    <br>
    In most cases, the recovery of a service at its continuity site is not
    going to fix the incident (for example, when a
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Bug">bug</a> causes the incident). Implementing a fix in the
    service's current infrastructure might be more efficient and reliable. In such cases,
    the service owner determines if Change Management must coordinate the resolution of the incident. Change Management is required when the resolution
    of the incident causes:</p>

        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><ul>
          <li>Service to become
            unavailable or degraded during <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Service hours">service hours</a></li>
        </ul></td>

            different</li>
        </ul></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><ul>
          <li><a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#CMDB" class="bullet">CMDB</a> to require an update</li>
        </ul></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If Change Management is not required, the service owner ensures
    that the most appropriate specialists continue to resolve the incident within the Request Management process.<br>
    <br>
    If Change Management is required, the service owner consults with the
    specialists to understand the risks that could cause the implementation of
    the change to fail and the impact of the implementation on
    <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Customer">customers</a>. They figure out the best way
    to keep the risk and impact of the change implementation at an acceptable level. After they have
    established how the change should be implemented, the service owner asks the specialists to
    perform the implementation as an <a href="../Generic/Glossary.htm#Emergency change">emergency change</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The on-duty manager performs the role of service owner when the service owner
    of the affected service is not available.</p></td>
