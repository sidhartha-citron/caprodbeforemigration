        When the request is created by a template that contains the workflow for implementing the request, the service desk analyst or specialist 
        reviews the tasks that are created by the template and determines if 
        additional tasks are required. If required, the additional tasks are created 
        and linked to the request.<br>
	<br>
        Next, the service desk analyst or specialist determines which tasks can be completed without involving others and assigns these tasks 
        to themselves.<br>
        For each remaining task, the service desk analyst or specialist determines 
        the  appropriate person to complete this task. Tasks that 
        should be completed by other service desk analysts or specialists are 
        assigned to:<br>
        <br>
	    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><ul>
          <li>Appropriate staff when 
            the  staff is in the same group as the service desk analyst or specialist handling the request</li>
        </ul></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><ul>
          <li>Group coordinator of the target group if the appropriate specialist is in another group</li>
        </ul></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bullet"></td>
        <td width="95%" valign="top" align="left"><ul>
          <li>Group coordinator of the target group if the appropriate specialist is not known</li>
        </ul></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
	  <p><br>
        When assigning the tasks, consider the order of completing these tasks. The order ensures that the assigned tasks do not require other 
        tasks to be completed first.<br>
        <br>
        The service desk analyst or specialist responsible for handling the request 
        completes the tasks assigned to them and monitors the completion 
        of the remaining tasks. When required, they can create additional tasks and 
        assign the tasks. When all tasks are completed successfully, the request is completed.      </p>
