    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for stopping by our booth at PM Expo last week. We were thrilled to announce our name change from Cannon Services to Citron Hygiene.

While we are still offering the same great services: Washroom Hygiene, Pest Control and Life Safety, we have also added Dishwashing and Chemical Services to our repertoire.

Please feel free to reach out if you feel we could help you in any of the above areas and we would be happy to send a representative to do a survey of your facility.

Regards,

Citron Hygiene - formerly Cannon Services
