    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

It was great meeting you at the CFAA Conference last week. I hope you enjoyed the breakout sessions and trade show as much as I did.

Have you ever considered Cannon Pest Control for your building?  We are currently doing many multi-residential buildings in Ontario and Quebec and I would love to send someone to come out, bring you a coffee and do an evaluation of your building.

When it comes to pest control, apartment and condominium buildings have to be treated differently than other commercial buildings. This is because each unit is connected to each other by electrical, plumbing and heating. This gives pests an easy road to find new food sources. Cockroaches, Bed Bugs and even Mice all use these routes to go from one unit to the next, making Pest Control very difficult.

Are you free next week for a coffee?

Regards,

Jarrett Rose
