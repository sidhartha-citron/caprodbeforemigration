  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> I know <b>many businesses rely on ready-to-use chemicals</b> to clean their business. This format has <b>high use costs</b> and is <b>bad for the</b> <b>environment</b>. On average, ready-to-use cleaning products cost <b><i>5x more per use</i></b> than concentrated solutions!<br /> <br /> As businesses increase daily cleaning measures, many are citing <b>added cleaning costs</b>. Managing these costs while overseeing cleaning protocols can be difficult to balance, which is why I wanted to share a <b>solution</b> to help you <b>maintain your business’s cleanliness</b>.<br /> <br /> In the <b>email attachment</b>, you will find details on one of our <b>most popular</b> chemical products – <b>Monopods</b>. Monopods are ultra-concentrated cleaning pods that dissolve in water to create a powerful cleaning solution in <b>2 minutes</b>. To use, drop the cleaning pod into a spray bottle, fill with water and shake. Each container makes <b>25 bottles</b> of cleaning solution. <b>Reduce single-use plastic, reduce cleaning costs, repurchase less frequently, save storage space </b>and<b> refill on the go! </b><br /> <br /> As daily cleaning has never been more important, I wanted to share this <b>special deal</b> Citron Hygiene put together for you. The package includes <b>disinfectant</b>, <b>washroom cleaner</b>, <b>glass cleaner</b>, <b>surface degreaser</b> and <b>4 spray bottles</b>! Details and price&nbsp;<b>are in the attachment</b>. With this carefully selected package, you will have <b>peace-of-mind</b> knowing your business has all the cleaning supplies it needs.<br /> <br /> Citron Hygiene has a wide range of cleaning solutions and chemicals available to support businesses during <b>COVID-19</b>. I look forward to answering any questions you may have and further discussing our innovative chemical line, <b>Monopods</b>.</span></span>
