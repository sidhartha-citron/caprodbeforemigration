  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Employees, guests and patrons are counting on you to <b>increase hygiene measures</b> and create a <b>safe</b> and <b>healthy facility</b>. It is no surprise that within a facility, the spaces that are the most frequented such as the <b>washroom</b>, <b>lobbies</b> and <b>cafeterias</b> typically have the <b>largest risks of bacteria</b>. These areas often prove challenging to clean, as they have <b>consistent traffic</b> and most disinfection practices are left until after operating hours.</span></span></span> 
  <br /> 
  <br /> <span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Throughout the day, each time an individual enters these spaces, <b>bacteria and impurity counts grow.</b>&nbsp;With a clear need for continuous hygiene measures in shared spaces, I am excited to share with you Citron's newest service,&nbsp;<b>SaniZone Air &amp; Surface Hygiene.</b></span></span></span></span></span> 
  <br /> 
  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">SaniZone is an innovative service, exclusive to Citron Hygiene that provides treatment to<b>&nbsp;the air and surfaces</b> and in addition, <b>removes harsh odours</b>. This service is <b>ideal for high traffic areas</b>, as it works&nbsp;<b>24/7</b>, ensuring the environment is continuously treated.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Essentially, the unit will draw in the air treating it with&nbsp;an Ultraviolet UVC light. Additionally, the unit continuously releases <b>photo plasma</b>, <b>ozone</b> and <b>negative ions</b>&nbsp;to treat<b>&nbsp;the air and surfaces</b>, <b>including hard-to-reach surfaces</b> that are often missed in daily cleanings.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Not only is SaniZone innovative, but it is also <b>proven to be effective</b>! Independent testing has demonstrated SaniZone's ability to&nbsp;<b>reduce surface impurities by 99.999% in only two minutes of treatment</b>. The unit is also <b>environmentally friendly</b>, as it is free of harsh chemicals and requires minimal costs for your facility to operate.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">As proper hygiene measures have never been more <b>important</b>, I am sure this opportunity to elevate hygiene and augment daily cleaning <b>excites</b> you. I would like to set a time to further discuss the benefits of SaniZone and receive insight as to where the <b>ideal placement</b> of the unit would be for your facility.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Does <span style="color:#d35400;"><b>DAY, MONTH, 00 at 00:00 am / pm</b></span> work to discuss how SaniZone could contribute to your facilityâ€™s hygiene?</span></span></span> 
  <br /> 
  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Sincerely,</span></span>
