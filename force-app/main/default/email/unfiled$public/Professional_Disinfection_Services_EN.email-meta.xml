    <textOnly>Hi  {!WorkOrder.Contact},

Please see attached for your Citron Hygiene SaniGuardTM Certificate which can be printed and placed throughout your facility.

This certificate lets everyone who enters your washrooms know that touchpoints are disinfected using a hospital-grade disinfectant, and that an antimicrobial film remains active for added protection.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the certificates, please reach out customersucess@citronhygiene.com.

Thank you,
{!WorkOrder.LastModifiedBy}</textOnly>
