  <br /> <span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:106%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Thank you for visiting Citron Hygiene’s website and for requesting our <b>Manufacturing Case Study. </b></span></span></span></span></span> 
  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="line-height:106%">I know you are under tremendous responsibility, managing the production of your facility while balancing the health of your employees. I understand this has been an especially challenging task, given the impacts of COVID-19 and I wanted to let you know that <b>Citron Hygiene is here to help</b>.<br /> <br /> Research suggests that <b>one sick employee can infect up to 50% of people and surfaces within 4 hours</b>! As a manufacturing facility, this can pose a detrimental effect on your business’s productivity and employee absenteeism. To better prevent the spread of disease and bacteria, many <b>facilities practice preventative hygiene measures. </b><br /> <br /> One of the most common hygiene measures that I have found many manufacturing facilities implementing to reduce virus transmission is incorporating <b>touch-free fixtures within the washroom</b>.&nbsp; With over <b>80% of germs being spread by hands</b>, touching washrooms surfaces can pose a large threat to your facility as these surfaces commonly are found to have a variety of bacteria and viruses present on them including; fecal and human-gut bacteria.<br /> <br /> At Citron Hygiene, we specialize in building healthy spaces. With over 45 years of experience, we have the resources to help businesses <b>minimize threats of viruses and bacteria</b> within their facility. Our solutions incorporate convenient and practical use that <b>limit the amount of contact an individual makes with surfaces in the washroom</b>.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:106%">As per your request, <b>please find attached the Manufacturing Case Study</b>. I would like to set a meeting to further discuss the results of this case study and what hygiene solutions could benefit your facility, and in turn – increase your employee well-being and facility productivity!<br /> <br /> I am available for a virtual meeting, does <b><span style="color:#d35400">DAY</span></b>, <b><span style="color:#d35400">Month</span></b> at <b><span style="color:#d35400">0:00</span></b> work for you?<br /> <b><span style="color:#d35400">**REMEMBER TO INSERT MEETING DETAILS ABOVE!!**</span></b><br /> <br /> Thank you,</span></span></span>
