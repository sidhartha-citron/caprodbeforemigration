   Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, 
  <br /> 
  <br /> With restrictions loosing and <b>travel increasing</b>, airports are preparing to welcome back <b>higher amounts </b>of travelers. Airports are responsible for making customers feel as comfortable as possible when flying. That's why they need to ensure they are properly equipped to maintain<b> consistently high hygiene levels.</b>&nbsp; 
  <br /> 
  <br /> I know health and safety is top of mind for every airport, and partnering with a trusted service provider can help ease that burden. Citron Hygiene has created an <b>Airports Case Study</b> tha<i>t highlights the importance of elevated hygiene,</i> and <i>provides recommendations</i> on what airports need to <b>give travelers</b> the <b>peace of mind</b> they deserve.&nbsp;

I am available for both in-person and virtual meetings, does&nbsp;<b><span style="color:#e74c3c;">MONTH&nbsp;DATE&nbsp;at&nbsp;0:00 am / pm</span>&nbsp;</b>work for you?&nbsp;Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
