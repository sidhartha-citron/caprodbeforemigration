  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}<br /> <br /> I know the hygiene conditions of your business are of top priority impacting employee and customer experience. With the pandemic reshaping an individual’s perception of public health risks, I know many businesses are now looking to <b>decrease</b> <b>risks</b> of virus transmission in shared spaces.<br /> <br /> I wanted to reach out and share some of my knowledge on virus transmission, as I often notice many are <b>unaware</b> as to how many bacteria hotspots there are within a facility.&nbsp; <b>One of the main spots of virus transmission is the sanitary disposal bin</b>, which most commonly is made of stainless steel and requires touch-operation.<br /> <br /> In light of the pandemic, it has been revealed that <b>COVID-19 can last on stainless steel for 72 hours</b>, and viruses such as <b>Hepatitis</b> and <b>Staph</b> are also frequently found within these units. These factors, coupled with standard bacteria found within the washroom place anyone who uses these items at risk, as well as <b>comprises the hygiene conditions of your mall</b> through surface-to-person transmission and cross-contamination.<br /> <br /> I would like to help you protect your business and patrons, by providing you with <b>insight</b> on how to manage these health risks. At Citron Hygiene, we have spent the past 45 years providing hygiene services to commercial properties. One of our most common services is <b>personal hygiene disposal</b> where we will provide each toilet with a <b>touch-free</b> disposal unit for sanitary waste (brochure attached). During the service, our technician places an all-natural <b>treatment agent</b> within the unit and ensures working function.<br /> <br /> Given the importance of environmental awareness, I thought I should mention that <b>all waste generated through Citron’s disposal services is taken off-site where it is then sent for waste-to-energy conversion</b>. I have included a sample diversion report for your review where this business was able to divert 34 lbs of waste from landfills.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Throughout COVID-19, Citron Hygiene has <b>helped</b> many businesses create a hygiene service plan that elevates their company’s cleanliness and image. I would like to set a meeting to further discuss your current hygiene program and what other businesses of your size are doing in comparison.<br /> <br /> I look forward to hearing from you and making an impact on your facility’s hygiene.<br /> <br /> Sincerely,</span></span>
