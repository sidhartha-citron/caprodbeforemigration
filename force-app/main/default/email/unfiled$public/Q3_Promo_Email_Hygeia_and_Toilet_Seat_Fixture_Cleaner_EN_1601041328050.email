  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">One of the best practices when analyzing your facility for health risks is to think of <b>key bacterial hotspots</b>. Washrooms often act as a <b>bacterial breeding ground</b>, making it imperative proper hygiene protocols are implemented to <b>prevent germs and bacteria from becoming widespread in a facility</b>.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Over <b>60% </b>of people avoid making any direct contact with washroom fixtures, including the <b>toilet seat</b>, <b>toilet flush-handle</b> and <b>sanitary disposal unit</b>. These fixtures often harbour harmful bacteria creating anxiety for washroom users.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Citron Hygiene has extensive experience providing businesses with the resources to ensure <b>proper washroom hygiene</b>. I know it can often feel overwhelming deciding what protocols are best to implement, so I have included a small overview below on what services I find to be <b>most popular</b> with businesses of your nature.</span></span></span>

  <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">Implementing efforts to better maintain your washroom hygiene can in-turn, <b>protect the health of your facility</b> as you are reducing risks for <b>cross-contamination</b> and <b>surface-to-person transmission</b>. It is important to remember that these efforts also send a larger message to your patrons, that you <b>care</b> about their <b>well-being</b> and you have invested effort in <b>protecting their health</b>.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Citron Hygiene has extensive experience helping businesses <b>implement</b> the <b>proper hygiene measures</b> that patrons are now counting on you to have. I would like to set up a meeting to further elaborate on what exactly these services entail and how we can help you <b>increase your patron experience</b>!</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">I am available for both in-person and skype meetings, does <b><span style="color:#c0392b;">MONTH</span> <span style="color:#c0392b;">DATE</span> at <span style="color:#c0392b;">0:00 am / pm</span> </b>work for you? I am looking forward to discussing what measures you would like to implement to better protect against the spread of viruses.</span></span></span>
