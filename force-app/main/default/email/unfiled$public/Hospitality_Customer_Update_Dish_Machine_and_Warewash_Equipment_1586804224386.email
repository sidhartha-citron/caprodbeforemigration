    Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, 
   <br /> 
   <br /> As COVID-19 continues to progress throughout North America, the well-being of our customers and employees remains a top priority. We realize these are difficult times and would like to assure you that Citron Hygiene is doing everything possible to support our customers.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> As a key service provider to the hospitality industry, we are aware of how recent mandates to close public dining rooms have affected business. <b>Citron Hygiene has decided to pause billing for the rental of dish machines and ware-wash equipment for April and May</b>. This billing adjustment will be applied to any customer who has had to temporarily close due to COVID-19. During this period, we would like to remind our customers that terms of your contract still apply and the amounts owing from April and May will be applied to the end of your term.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> We realize the hospitality industry has been put into a challenging position and&nbsp;commend our customers on their efforts to combat this pandemic. While COVID-19 continues to develop throughout Canada, businesses are now faced with a new priority, ensuring their space is safe for their employees and customers to return. Citron Hygiene would like to extend our service offering, with our <i><b><a href="https://www.citronhygiene.com/professional-disinfection-services/">professional disinfection service</a></b></i>. &nbsp;This service provides thorough disinfection of your facility, including key touch-points using a DIN approved disinfectant. Your facility must have the means to control outbreaks and eliminate contaminated spaces. These practices are crucial to avoid future outbreaks. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Citron Hygiene is committed to supporting our customers during this time. It is important to Citron Hygiene that our customers are given the necessary relief to withstand the pandemic. We are confident that our support during this time will help the hospitality industry come back stronger than ever.&nbsp; 
   <br /> 
   <br /> If you have any questions regarding your account, please do not hesitate to reach out to our Customer Success Team.
