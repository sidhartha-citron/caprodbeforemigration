   <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</span></span> 
   <br /> 
   <br /> <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">I know you are under tremendous responsibility, managing the production of your facility while balancing the health of your employees. I understand this has been an especially challenging task as of late, given the impacts of COVID-19 and I wanted to let you know that <b>Citron Hygiene is here to help</b>.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">As manufacturing facilities typically have employees adhere to one schedule during a shift, key areas of your facility can easily become occupied with multiple people at once creating <b>increased threats of virus transmission</b>.&nbsp; Due to the nature of manufacturing, many find it difficult to limit risks of surface-to-person transmission and cross-contamination especially in areas such as the <b>washroom</b>.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">Research suggests that <b>one sick employee can infect up to 50% of people and surfaces within 4 hours</b>! As a manufacturing facility, this can pose a detrimental effect on your business’s productivity and employee absenteeism. To better prevent the spread of disease and bacteria, many <b>facilities practice preventative hygiene measures. </b></span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">One of the most common hygiene measures that I have found many manufacturing facilities implementing to reduce virus transmission is incorporating <b>touch-free fixtures within the washroom</b>.&nbsp; With over <b>80% of germs being spread by hands</b>, touching washrooms surfaces can pose a large threat to your facility as these surfaces commonly are found to have a variety of bacteria and viruses present on them including; fecal and human-gut bacteria.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">At Citron Hygiene, we specialize in building healthy spaces. With over 45 years of experience, we have the resources to help businesses <b>minimize threats of viruses and bacteria</b> within their facility. Our solutions incorporate convenient and practical use that <b>limit the amount of contact an individual makes with surfaces in the washroom</b>. Many of the manufacturing plants I work with accredit their facility hygiene and employee well-being to the services listed in the <b>attached manufacturing industry paper</b>.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">I would like to set a meeting to further discuss what hygiene solutions could benefit your facility, and in turn – increase your employee well-being and facility productivity!</span><br /> <br /> <span style="line-height:107%">I am available for both a virtual and in-person meetings, does <span style="color:#d35400;"><b>DAY</b></span>, <span style="color:#d35400;"><b>Month</b></span> at <span style="color:#d35400;"><b>0:00</b></span> work for you?</span><br /> <span style="color:#d35400;"><b>**REMEMBER TO INSERT MEETING DETAILS ABOVE!!**</b></span><br /> <br /> <span style="text-align: justify;">Thank you,</span><br /> <br /> {{{Sender.Name}}}<br /> <img alt="Signature - CA" src="{[devName:Signature_CA]}" style="max-width: 1287.440069580078px" title="Signature - CA" /></span></span>
